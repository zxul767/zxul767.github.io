### Quantification of Uncertainty in Perception
Unlike CNNs and most kinds of NNs (fundamentally evidence weighing mechanisms), brains must have an additional component in their architecture which allows them to calibrate the confidence of its perceptions based not just on the presence or absence of familiar objects, but also on the presence of unfamiliar information (e.g., if a child has seen dogs and cats, but never before a chick, upon their first encounter, they're likely to be surprised because it has at least two unfamiliar features: its beak and legs, which are unlike those of any dogs or cats watched before.)
