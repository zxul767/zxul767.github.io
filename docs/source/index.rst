    \nabla^2 f =
    \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
    \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}
    \left( \sin \theta \, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}
