.. _bulldozer_intelligence:

+ **Bulldozer Intelligence**: this is a term coined by `Patrick Winston <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston>`_ to describe procedures which solve problems by performing (at least in principle) an exhaustive search of the solution space. For those willing to accept the broad definition of intelligence outlined in :ref:`intelligence`, game engines which perform a "careful" brute force search of the solution space can be considered examples of bulldozer intelligence.
